# Retail_Database

The goal of my project is to showcase my ability in developing and implementing a functional database management system that will help manage a fictional convenience store business named Mini-Mart. The database will be easy to use, while also providing some unique insights on how to make the business more profitable. The database will support the relationships between the business and the community it serves. It will document and track employee information, item inventory levels, customer purchase history, among other things. The use of my database will increase accuracy, accountability, profits, and more. 

Currently, the business uses an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of everything. However, as we already know, Microsoft Excel is not a viable tool to support the management of an entire database system. Along with having a limit to the number of records an Excel spreadsheet can contain, the performance of the application slows down considerably as you incrementally reach those limits. The lack of version control and the lack of data manipulation tools in Excel also prevents a business from running optimally. Another issue that comes up when using Excel is that the tables across the organization do not automatically connect to each other. This prevents the seamless transfer of information from one table to another (Holmes, 2020). 

Databases in general have a lot of benefits to any organization. Through Postgresql, Mini-Mart will have fewer data redundancies and fewer inconsistencies than a typical file-processing system. The business’ information will be easily accessible to anyone who is authorized. A centralized database will make it efficient to retrieve all sorts of information in comparison to isolated data locations that make collecting and analyzing data more cumbersome than it has to be. 

To complement the business’ new database, a Tableau dashboard will be developed so stakeholders can quickly access relevant metrics that will help them support the business further. With the implementation of these new tools and resources, The Mini-Mart will be able to better serve their customers and generate more profits moving forward.



# Data and Functional Requirements

Describe the information that will be stored in the database while considering the relationships and constraints for the entities

List the functional requirements

Develop an ER Model using LucidChart

Construct a Relational Database Schema Diagram using LucidChart SQL DDL

○ Create DDL statements that define the relations identified in the schema

- Create eight tables storing different types of information
- Create two views definitions and describe who would use these views
- Create two general SQL functions and describe its purpose
- Create one trigger and describe its purpose
- Create one stored procedure and describe its purpose and function

SQL DML

○ For each table, provide the following:
- Five insert statements
- One update statement
- One delete statement
- Consider referential integrity constraints for all statements Construct eight SQL queries

○ For each query, state the query in plain english along with the business relevance

Develop a web application in Python using the Flask framework to interact with the database

○ The code will connect to the database and will perform the following actions:
- Read some data from the database and display it to the user
- Change some data in the database by updating or deleting record(s)

Create a Tableau dashboard that displays relevant analytics to measure the business’ performance and that helps make informed decisions

○ Connect the database to the Tableau workbook
○ Develop an easy-to-consume dashboard displaying relevant business metrics

Record a video presentation walking through the entire project and its requirements

○ Video will be recorded in Zoom and uploaded to the Brightspace Media Gallery

The main goal of this project is to create a working postgres database that will manage the business efficiently and effectively. It will provide stakeholders with relevant information of the performance of the business while also identifying needs of the convenience store.
