-- Query 5 --

-- This query will tell us how many items were sold by each employee on each day. --
-- The table is organized by the employee who has sold the most items. --
-- Since this is a new system for the business, the previous method (MS Excel) did not track items sold --

select ee.employee_name, sum(item_count) as Items_Sold, transaction_date
from transactions as tt inner join employee as ee on tt.employee_id = ee.employee_id
group by transaction_date, employee_name
order by 2 desc;
