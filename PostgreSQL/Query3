-- Query 3 -- 

-- This query allows us to see the total amount of sales by each employee who is not a Manager or an Assistant Manager. --
-- We also get the number of transactions and the average amount per transaction through a calculation. --
-- This query will give us an idea which non-management employee completes the most transactions too. --

SELECT DISTINCT(Employee_Name), SUM(Total_amount) AS Total_Amount, 
				COUNT(Transaction_ID) AS Transaction_Count, 
				(SUM(Total_amount)/COUNT(Transaction_ID)) AS AVG_Amount
FROM Employee FULL OUTER JOIN Transactions ON Employee.Employee_ID = Transactions.Employee_ID
FULL OUTER JOIN Job ON Employee.Employee_ID = Job.Employee_ID
WHERE Job.Job_ID != '5' AND Job.Job_ID != '7'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
