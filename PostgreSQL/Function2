-- Function 2 --

-- This function will return the items that are below the inventory threshold the user passes in --
-- An integer is passed in the function which sets the limit for the inventory_count and the function will return which items fall below that value --
-- The goal is to be able to inform the employee what items they might be selling out of based on current quantity levels -- 
-- This function can also help organize the stock room as it can tell you what items we have most of as well --
