-- Query 4 -- 

-- This query utilizes the union operator to combine two different queries into one table. --
-- Here we find every transaction that is associated with a survey left by a customer. -- 
-- We can also learn what type of feedback was left for the business along with the employee name who performed the transaction. --

SELECT Employee.employee_id, transaction_id, employee_name
FROM Employee INNER JOIN Feedback on Employee.employee_id = Feedback.employee_id

UNION ALL

SELECT survey_id, transaction_id, survey_type
FROM Feedback
WHERE Feedback.transaction_id != 0
ORDER BY 2;
