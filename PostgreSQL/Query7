-- Query 7 --

-- This query uses the EXCEPT operator. -- 
-- This will find all the customers of the store who have not left feedback. --
-- The first select statment finds all the unique customer_ids and customer_names, --
-- while the second select statment finds all the customers who have submitted feedback. --
-- However, the EXCEPT operator excludes everyone in the second select statement. -- 

SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, customer_name, customer_since, transaction_count
FROM Customer
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT Customer.customer_id, customer.customer_name, customer_since, transaction_count
FROM Feedback INNER JOIN Customer ON Customer.customer_id = Feedback.customer_id;
