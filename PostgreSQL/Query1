-- Query 1 -- 

-- This query provides information regarding every employee of the business. --
-- Along with their name and employee ID, we obtain their job title, rate, vacation hours and more. --
-- The results are ordered from lowest to highest rates. --
-- This gives us an idea on which employees have the most available paid time off as well. --

SELECT e.employee_name, e.employee_id, j.job_title, j.job_id, 
		j.rate, e.hire_date, e.vacation_hours, e.sick_hours
FROM Employee AS e 
INNER JOIN Job AS j ON e.employee_id = j.employee_id
ORDER BY rate;
